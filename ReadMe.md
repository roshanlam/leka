# Leka

https://leka.fly.dev/

Leka (Write in Nepali) is a note taking website written using node, expressjs, ejs and mongodb as the main tech stack.

The key features are basically being able to create notes where basic latex code can be written along with markdown code and being able to have all those notes saved in the users account.

To use the website simply signup and create an account and then create some notes. Simple as that :)

In terms of configuring and connecting to the database is not needed since it has already been done.

Note: The Dockerfile and .toml have been created by fly.io when I deployed the website. 

## Running Locally
